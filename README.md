The Data and code within this post are investigating the microbial community composition of the James River rock pool ecosystem. The metadata.tsv file is the environmental data collected from previous studies/sampling trips. The Rock Pool sequence data has the relative abundance data sampled from the individual rock pools separated by phylum level. I am looking at the biodiversity of the mirobes within the pools and what environmental factor has the largest influence.
